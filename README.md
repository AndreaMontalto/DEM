This project is a team assignmet conducted during the third year of my Bachelor in International Business Administration.
 As part of my track Analytical Decision Makers, the first course followed was Data Engineering and Management in which I learned about data cleaning and preparation for analysis. 
 Indeed, the corse of this assignment stand in preparing a dataset containing information about apple store apps which will be used for machine learning and classification of the 
 applications based on how many reviews they have received from users. Generally, if the app has received more than the median amout of reviews, then it will be classified as an app 
 that has received a high number of reviews, otherwise it will fall in the Low category
